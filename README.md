DOM and Event Fundamentals
|
2. Document Object Model (DOM)
The DOM is the structured representation of the HTML document created by the browser. 
It allows JavaScript to manipulate, structure, and style your website.

1.The getElementById()-->method helps to select the HTML Element with a specific ID.
2.To manipulate the text within the HTML Element, we use textContentProperty.
3.2.5 Events

*Events are the actions by which the user or browser interacts with the HTML Elements. Actions can be anything like clicking a button, pressing keyboard keys, scrolling the page, etc.
a) onclick Event--->The onclickevent occurs when the user clicks on an HTML Element. 
We will give the name of the function as a value for the HTML onclick attribute.

Difference between let and var:
A var variable can be redeclared and updated. A let variable can be updated but can't be redeclared.

let points = 4;
let points = 5; //points has already been declared(warning message)

var score = 4;
var score = 5; // no warning
